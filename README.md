        <h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>
        <p>The Pomodoro Timer is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library. It helps users manage their time effectively by following the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Customizable Timer: Users can set the duration of work sessions (default: 25 minutes), short breaks (default: 5 minutes), and long breaks (default: 20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Visual Feedback: The timer visually indicates whether it's a work session or a break, with the timer changing colors accordingly.</li>
            <li>Task Progress: Users can track their work progress with checkmarks displayed after each completed work session.</li>
            <li>Start and Reset: Simple buttons to start and reset the timer.</li>
